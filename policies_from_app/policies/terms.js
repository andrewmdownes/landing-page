## Important Legal Notice

Ribit is a cost‑sharing ride coordination platform, not a Transportation Network Company ("TNC"). Under Florida law, a “prearranged ride” for TNC purposes does not include ridesharing, carpooling, or any other service in which the driver’s fee does not exceed the driver’s cost to provide the ride. Ribit facilitates cost‑sharing between drivers and riders; drivers on Ribit must not earn more than their reasonable pro‑rata costs for a trip. As such, Ribit is not a TNC and is not subject to Florida’s TNC‑specific statutes that apply to Uber/Lyft‑style for‑hire transportation.[Legal summary]

By using the Ribit mobile application (the "Application") and related services (collectively, the "Services"), you agree to these Terms of Service (the "Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Application.

You must be at least 18 years old to use Ribit.

## 1. What Ribit Is (and Is Not)

1.1 Ribit connects individuals to coordinate shared trips where riders contribute toward a driver’s costs (e.g., fuel, tolls, parking, routine wear). Ribit is not a common carrier, taxicab, livery, charter, or for‑hire transportation provider.

1.2 Drivers are private individuals using their personal vehicles and personal insurance. Drivers are independent users and are not employees, agents, representatives, or contractors of Ribit. Ribit does not supervise, control, or direct drivers' operations, schedules, routes, or conduct. Each driver is solely responsible for maintaining adequate insurance, complying with all applicable laws, and ensuring vehicle safety.

1.3 Cost‑Share Rule. Drivers may only receive contributions that do not exceed their reasonable costs for a given trip. Examples include fuel, tolls, parking, and reasonable per‑mile cost of vehicle operation. Drivers must not profit from trips, set surge pricing, or operate as for‑hire transportation.

1.4 No TNC Status. Because contributions are capped at cost, Ribit and its users are not engaged in TNC “prearranged rides.” TNC‑specific requirements (e.g., TNC background checks, TNC vehicle inspections, TNC commercial insurance minimums) do not apply to Ribit’s cost‑sharing trips. This does not eliminate normal obligations under general traffic, insurance, and safety laws that apply to all motorists.

## 2. Eligibility and Accounts

2.1 Age. You represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.

2.2 Account Security. You are responsible for account activity and for safeguarding credentials. Notify ribitapp@gmail.com of unauthorized access.

2.3 Truthful Information. You agree to provide accurate information and keep it updated.

## 3. Driver Responsibilities

3.1 Lawful Driving. Obey all laws, including licensing, registration, insurance, seat‑belt/child‑restraint, and traffic rules.

3.2 Insurance. You must have and maintain appropriate insurance coverage for all rides and any accidents that may occur during a ride, including without limitation personal injury protection insurance coverage for your vehicle with no less than the minimum limits required by applicable law. You are solely responsible for ensuring your insurance policy covers cost‑sharing rideshare activities, for verifying coverage with your insurer before offering rides, and for complying with all policy terms and conditions. Insurance coverage is your responsibility; Ribit does not provide insurance for drivers or vehicles.

3.3 Vehicle Condition. Use a roadworthy vehicle maintained in safe operating condition.

3.4 No For‑Hire Conduct. Do not solicit or provide transportation for profit, do not meter or surge prices, do not repeatedly operate trips that would constitute for‑hire service.

3.5 Cost Calculation. Set contributions transparently and reasonably to reflect trip costs; do not exceed cost. Upon request from Ribit or a rider, provide a simple breakdown (e.g., miles x per‑mile cost, fuel/tolls/parking).

## 4. Rider Responsibilities

4.1 Shared Cost. Riders contribute toward trip costs displayed in the Application.

4.2 Conduct. Be punctual, respectful, and comply with safety requirements (seat belts, no open containers, etc.). Riders are responsible for any damage to the driver's vehicle or property caused by their actions or negligence.

4.3 Personal Items. You are responsible for your belongings; Ribit is not liable for loss/damage.

4.4 Payment Obligations. By booking a ride, you authorize Ribit to charge your payment method for the total amount shown. You agree not to dispute authorized charges or initiate fraudulent chargebacks.

4.5 Rider Liability. Riders assume all risks associated with ridesharing and acknowledge that drivers are private individuals, not professional transportation providers. You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Ribit, the driver, and all related parties from any claims arising from your participation in a trip, including property damage, personal injury, or misconduct.

## 5. Payments, Fees, and Refunds

5.1 Contributions. Ribit processes rider contributions through third‑party payment processors (e.g., Stripe) and remits net amounts to drivers via their selected payment method (PayPal, Venmo, or Zelle). Ribit may charge a platform fee to defray operating costs. The platform fee does not convert trips into for‑hire service. Payment processing fees charged by third parties are non‑refundable.

5.2 Timing. Driver payouts generally occur within approximately 72 hours after trip completion, subject to successful payment processing and verification.

5.3 Cancellations/Refunds. Unless otherwise shown in‑app: full refund up to 24 hours before departure (less platform fees and payment processing fees); 50% refund if canceled within 24 hours (less fees); no refund if canceled within 30 minutes of departure or no‑show. If a driver cancels within 24 hours, rider receives a full refund of contribution and platform fee (payment processing fees are non‑refundable).

5.4 Payment Disputes and Chargebacks. You agree not to initiate chargebacks or payment disputes for authorized transactions. Unauthorized chargebacks or false payment disputes may result in immediate account termination and liability for all costs, fees, and damages incurred by Ribit. If a chargeback or payment dispute results in a loss to Ribit or a driver, you agree to reimburse all amounts, plus administrative fees and costs. Ribit reserves the right to withhold payments, suspend accounts, or take legal action to recover losses from fraudulent disputes.

5.5 Payment Processing Disclaimer. Ribit uses third‑party payment processors and is not responsible for payment processing errors, delays, failures, or disputes between users and payment processors. You agree that payment processors' terms govern the processing of payments.

## 6. Safety and Screening

6.1 User Responsibility. Ribit does not conduct or guarantee background checks, driving record checks, or insurance verification. Any document review performed by Ribit is for platform integrity only and does not constitute an endorsement, guarantee, or verification of insurance coverage, driver qualifications, or vehicle safety. Users are solely responsible for their own evaluation and due diligence regarding co‑riders and drivers, and may choose not to proceed with any trip.

6.2 Optional Verifications. Ribit may offer optional identity, document, or driver‑status verifications for user trust and safety. Such features are not endorsements or guarantees.

6.3 Zero‑Tolerance Policy. Impaired driving and threatening/violent behavior are strictly prohibited. Report safety concerns to local authorities and to ribitapp@gmail.com.

## 7. Disclaimers and Allocation of Risk

7.1 No Warranty. The Services are provided “as is” and “as available.” Ribit disclaims implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non‑infringement.

7.2 Third‑Party Content. Ribit is not responsible for user content or third‑party links.

7.3 Assumption of Risk. Ride‑sharing involves inherent risks, including but not limited to risks of property damage, bodily injury, or death. By using Ribit, you knowingly and voluntarily assume all risks arising from interactions and travel with other users, including risks related to driver qualifications, vehicle condition, insurance coverage, and road safety. You acknowledge that Ribit does not guarantee the insurance coverage of any driver or vehicle.

8.3 Indemnity. You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Ribit, its affiliates, officers, directors, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or relating to: (a) your use of the Services; (b) your conduct as a driver or rider; (c) any trip you participate in; (d) your breach of these Terms or violation of any law; (e) any accident, injury, or property damage occurring during a trip; (f) your insurance coverage or lack thereof; or (g) any dispute between you and another user.

## 10. Disputes Between Users

Drivers and riders are solely responsible for resolving trip‑related disputes. Ribit may, but is not obligated to, assist with payment issues in its discretion.

## 11. Termination and Account Suspension

11.1 Right to Terminate. Ribit reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to refuse service, terminate accounts, remove or edit content, deny driver applications, revoke driver status, or cancel bookings at any time for any reason or no reason, including but not limited to violations of these Terms, unsafe conduct, fraud, legal risk, suspicious activity, or business reasons.

11.3 Effect of Termination. Upon termination, your right to use the Services ceases immediately. Ribit may withhold pending payments if termination is for cause. Sections 7, 8, 11.3, and 12 survive termination.

## 12. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration

12.1 Informal Resolution. Before filing a claim, you agree to contact Ribit at ribitapp@gmail.com to attempt to resolve the dispute informally for at least 30 days.

12.2 Binding Arbitration. If informal resolution fails, you agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be resolved by binding arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association (AAA) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules, rather than in court. The arbitration will be conducted in Gainesville, Florida, or remotely by video conference.

12.3 Class Action Waiver. YOU AND RIBIT AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. The arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims and may not preside over any form of representative or class proceeding.

12.4 Exceptions. Either party may seek injunctive relief in court for: (a) intellectual property infringement; (b) unauthorized access to the Services; or (c) violations of these Terms that threaten safety or security.

12.5 Arbitration Costs. Each party bears its own costs. If you cannot afford arbitration fees, Ribit will pay them upon request, subject to AAA rules.

## 13. Governing Law and Venue

Florida law governs these Terms without regard to conflict of law principles. To the extent arbitration does not apply, exclusive venue lies in state or federal courts located in Gainesville, Florida, and you consent to personal jurisdiction there.

## 14. Changes to These Terms

Ribit may update these Terms by posting revised terms. Continued use after posting constitutes acceptance.
